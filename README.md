# HackNightsCompetition
This repository contains starter code for the HackNights Completion! A basic speech-to-text setup based on the tutorial from Neural Nine on YouTube (https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9GJ6XeB-vMg&amp;t=29s)

## What do I do?!

To get set up, run two pip install commands in your terminal

```pip install speechrecognition```

```pip install pyttsx3```

Then just copy the repo and you're good to go!

## POG! Now what?

The time is yours now to build something cool with the speech recognition python library! Need some inspiration? Be sure to check out ```demo1.py``` and ```demo2.py``` for some examples! (And feel free to ctrl-c + ctrl-v that code too)
